# Software Engineering and Development

One of the most experiences during my master’s degree in CISBA came from CIDM‑6303 Technical Foundations in CIS. This course introduced me to the essential building blocks of computing and analytics: programming, database design, and web development. We explored structured and object‑oriented programming concepts, relational database management, SQL and so much more. The course also emphasized the importance of ethical considerations in technology and provided exposure to networking fundamentals.

The early weeks of CIDM‑6303 reinforced my confidence in SQL, where I practiced writing queries, managing relational schemas. Later, the course shifted toward web development, requiring me to build interfaces with HTML and CSS. This was my first real exposure to front‑end design, and while challenging, it gave me a deeper appreciation for how presentation and functionality intersect in analytics projects.

The most demanding portion of CIDM‑6303 was Python programming. Assignments required building and testing functions iteratively, which helped me understand the logic of coding but also revealed areas where I needed more practice. Toward the end of the course, we touched on popular Python libraries and introductory machine learning.

Beyond coding and databases, CIDM‑6303 course also incorporated Ethics and Networking modules. In Ethics, I studied and learn how algorithms can unintentionally harm society, such as biased advertising or healthcare systems that exclude vulnerable populations. We discussed accountability, bias amplification, and unintended consequences of technology. In Networking, which is more interesting portion, I learned about protocols, ports, DNS, DHCP, VPNs, and troubleshooting tools like traceroute and netstat. These lessons gave me a broader view and scope of how systems communicate securely and how analytics depends on reliable infrastructure.

Following CIDM‑6303, I enrolled in CIDM‑6325 Web Development and Database Integration. This course built directly on my earlier foundation on CIDM‑6303, emphasizing how to connect databases with web applications. I worked extensively with PostgreSQL, Django for web applications, designing schemas and writing queries that powered dynamic web projects. On the development side, I used HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks to create responsive interfaces that presented analytical insights.

The final project in CIDM‑6325 require integrating database engineering with front‑end design, essentially building a complete application that combined structured data with user‑friendly presentation. This project demonstrated how analytics can move beyond theory into practical systems that organizations can use to make decisions. It also introduced me to DevOps concepts, version control, and deployment workflows, which are critical for scaling solutions in real‑world environments.

## Reflections
Through these courses, I developed strong skills in:  
• SQL and relational database design  
• Python programming fundamentals  
• HTML/CSS for web interfaces  
• Ethics in technology and data governance  
• Networking protocols and troubleshooting tools  
• Database integration with web applications  

At the same time, I identified areas where I need growth as below:  
• Advanced Python development and frameworks like Django  
• Machine learning and statistical modeling  
• Visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI  
• Real‑time analytics and big data platforms  

## Summary of Capabilities
I now feel confident in my ability to do the below:  
• Design and query relational databases with integrity constraints  
• Build web‑based applications that integrate analytics and presentation  
• Apply ethical reasoning to technology projects  
• Understand networking fundamentals to support secure systems  
• Collaborate across disciplines to deliver data‑driven solutions  

## Future Considerations
Looking ahead, I plan to strengthen my foundation in software engineering and development by focusing on the below:  
• Advanced Python Development: Building applications from scratch, mastering frameworks like Django and Flask, and improving code optimization.  
• Cloud‑Based Development: Gaining hands‑on experience with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to design scalable applications.  
• DevOps and Automation: Expanding my knowledge of CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and Kubernetes to streamline deployment and improve reliability.  
• Machine Learning Integration: Applying Python libraries such as Scikit‑learn and TensorFlow to embed predictive models into applications.  
• Cybersecurity in Development: Incorporating secure coding practices and vulnerability testing into the software lifecycle.  
• Professional Certifications: Pursuing credentials in software engineering and cloud development to validate and expand my expertise.  

These future goals will allow me to evolve from building foundational applications into designing robust, scalable, and secure systems that integrate analytics, governance, and business strategy.
