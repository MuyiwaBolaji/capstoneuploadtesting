# Data Management

During this course CIDM‑6350 my confidence level in SQL increase significantly. I was able to understand the differences between inner and outer joins, apply select statements with ordering, counts, and logical filters, and retrieve specific data needed for analysis. This course really helped me understand the importance and essence of Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), relational schemas, and the role of primary and foreign keys in enforcing referential integrity.

In CIDM‑6350 Data and Information Management, we go through a rigorous yet fulfilling syllabus and curriculum that aligned with learning objectives crucial for mastering database systems. We explored the role of database management and the value of information within organizations, reviewed the history and current trends of database models, and designed relational schemas evaluated against normalization rules. I became good and proficient in designing databases to meet business requirements by utilizing SQL for defining and manipulating data. Assignments required retrieving data from relational databases I created, which strengthened my technical problem‑solving skills and prepared me for real‑world challenges.

The City MD Urgent Care Database System project was one of the most difficult yet rewarding projects I have worked on. Here I created schema creation, ERDs, and normalization to third normal form, I built and tested a database end‑to‑end. The project involved over 10 tables, requiring careful enforcement of referential integrity through foreign key constraints. This ensured that patient records, staff assignments, billing, diagnostics, and appointments were all linked correctly without anomalies. Through hours of test‑driven development, I achieved a final product that demonstrated operational efficiency, improved patient flow, and enhanced data integrity for urgent care operations.

In CIDM‑6350 Database Systems, I further strengthened my foundation in relational database design, ERDs, and SQL queries. This course emphasized schema development and query optimization, which gave me confidence in handling structured data.

In CIDM‑6355 Data Mining course, I expanded my skills into clustering, classification, and regression using RapidMiner. I built workflows that included data preparation, model training, and evaluation, and conducted exploratory data analysis to derive actionable insights. These experiences helped me connect database management with analytics, showing how structured data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence.

Extensive use of RapidMiner for data mining tasks was good and rewarding

## Reflections on Strengths and Weaknesses
Through these two courses, I developed strong competencies in the below:  
• SQL query writing, schema design, and normalization.  
• ER and Enhanced ER diagramming for business requirements.  
• RapidMiner workflows for clustering and predictive modeling.  
• Data preparation, cleaning, and transformation for analysis.

At the same time, I identified areas where I remain weak:  
• Applying advanced normalization techniques in complex schema designs.  
• Modeling advanced ERDs with weak entities and hierarchies.  
• Limited proficiency in R programming beyond basic scripting and visualization.

## Future Learning Goals
To deepen my capabilities and experience going forward, I aim to:  
• Expand knowledge of machine learning algorithms beyond RapidMiner’s GUI.  
• Gain exposure to big data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases.  
• Develop proficiency in advanced visualization tools like Power BI for dynamic dashboards.
