# Business Analytics

Prior to my experience in CIDM‑6308 Seminar in Data Analytics and CIDM‑6312 Data Visualization and Ethical Design, my knowledge level was somewhere between novice and intermediate. I had some good exposure to SQL query statements, but my confidence in applying them in real life practice was limited. I also had little or no experience with Python and R, particularly in the context of time‑series visualization and clustering.

## CIDM‑6308 Seminar in Data AnalyticsThis course introduced me to clustering techniques, predictive modeling, and the use of RapidMiner which I found interesting. While the exercises were challenging, they provided a foundation for understanding supervised and unsupervised learning. I spent significant time outside of class self‑teaching RapidMiner, exploring decision trees, logistic regression, and clustering models. Although the course did not always provide deep conceptual reasoning behind tool selection, the exposure inspired me to experiment with predictive forecasting models for personal and professional interests.

RapidMiner became a tool I could envision applying in real‑world contexts, such as predicting customer churn or identifying risk patterns in Information technology sector and institutions. The most engaging aspect of CIDM‑6308 was the opportunity to connect clustering and SQL queries with Tableau dashboards. Even though the clustering exercises themselves were limited, they sparked my interest in how visualization and analytics can be combined to tell meaningful stories.

## CIDM‑6312 Data Visualization and Ethical DesignThis course focused on narrative visualization, time‑series analysis, and ethical communication of data. For this course, I strengthened my understanding of how audiences interpret visual information and how design color, hierarchy, clarity impact perception. I built dashboards during this course that emphasized storytelling and learned to balance technical accuracy with ethical responsibility.

The time‑series analysis component was indeed valuable, as it allowed me to apply Python and R in exploratory analysis and forecasting. While my proficiency in these languages remains limited, CIDM‑6312 gave me a reliable framework for how they can be applied in business analytics. The emphasis on ethical visualization also reinforced the importance of audience‑aware communication, a skill I now consider central to my analytics practice.

## Reflections on Strengths and WeaknessesThrough these two courses, I developed competencies in:  • Tableau dashboard design and narrative visualization.  • SQL for structured data preparation and querying.  • RapidMiner for clustering and predictive modeling.  • Critical reasoning with data, especially in ethical visualization.
At the same time, I identified areas where I remain weak:  • Limited proficiency in Python and R for advanced modeling.  • Minimal exposure to deploying analytics in full‑stack environments.  • Basic skills in Excel, with little confidence in dynamic dashboards.  • Limited experience with real‑time analytics and unstructured data.

## Future Learning GoalsLooking ahead, I wish to deepen my knowledge and understanding in the below areas:  • Real‑time data integration and streaming analytics.  • Data governance and cybersecurity for secure, ethical data handling.  • Deployment pipelines, including containerization and enterprise‑level dashboard deployment.
These areas represent the next stage of my growth, bridging the gap between classroom projects and enterprise‑scale solutions.
