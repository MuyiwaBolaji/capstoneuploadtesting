# What do you Know

During the course of CIDM 6350 and CIDM 6355, I have developed and built a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of data analytics. Below are my key competencies:

## Technical Skills

- **MYSQL/SQL:** I am knowledgeable in writing queries, performing joins, aggregations, and managing relational databases. My GitHub repository for CIDM 5350 includes examples of schema development and query optimization learnt during the course.
- **Draw.io for ER Diagrams:** I’ve used Draw.io substantially to model Enhanced ER diagrams and relational schemas, demonstrating my ability to translate business requirements into logical database structures.
- **Rapid Miner:** During the course CIDM 6355, I applied Rapid Miner for data mining tasks such as clustering, classification, and regression. My repository showcases some of the workflows that include data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data Identification and Preparation:** I have some hands-on with cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis, ensuring data integrity and relevance.
- **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Also during this course I’ve conducted exploratory data analysis and interpreted results to derive actionable insights, as seen in my CIDM 6355 projects.

## Supporting Evidence

- CIDM 5350 GitHub: ER diagrams, relational schema, SQL queries.  
- CIDM 6355 GitHub: Rapid Miner workflows, R scripts, data interpretation reports.

## Where are you Weak

Even though I’ve gained substantial and good skills, there are areas where I feel less confident and require further development:

- **Normalization Techniques:** Although I understand the theory behind normalization, applying it effectively in complex schema designs remains a bit of a challenge.
- **Enhanced ER Diagrams:** I have created basic diagrams during the course session, but struggle with advanced modeling involving weak entities, multi-valued attributes, and generalization hierarchies.
- **R Programming:** My proficiency in R is limited to basic scripting and visualization. As I will need to deepen my understanding of statistical modeling package usage, and performance optimization.

## What do you wish you knew

To feel more confident and deepen my data analytics capabilities, I recognize the need to:

- Expand my knowledge in Machine Learning Algorithms by having a deeper exposure to supervised and unsupervised learning techniques beyond Rapid Miner’s GUI.
- Familiarize myself with big data tools like Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases which would enhance my ability to work with large-scale datasets.
- Understand and have a deeper knowledge on Data Visualization, although I’ve used basic R plots, I’d like to learn Power BI for more dynamic and interactive dashboards.

## Summary Statement of Capabilities

Currently I am prepared to apply my data analytics skills in real-world settings. My ability to manage data and interpret results gives me a edge to contribute meaningfully to any data-driven project. I’ve demonstrated proficiency in SQL, data modeling, and mining techniques, and also working to be proficient in R programming and advanced modeling skills.  
My GitHub repositories serve as a portfolio of my work during the course, showcasing my technical growth and problem-solving abilities. I am okay in my capacity to build a prototype project that integrates data analytics with other areas.

## Integration with Capstone and Other Areas

### Why Data Analytics Is Integratable

Data Analytics is integratable with other areas because its the cornerstone of decision-making across all other areas, it integrate other areas as follows:

- Data Management: it integrate through structured storage, retrieval, and integrity enforcement.
- Software Systems: Integration by enabling intelligent features like recommendation engines and predictive analytics for the software systems.
- Networking and Cybersecurity: Data Analytics integrate through anomaly detection, log analysis, and threat modeling in Networking and Cybersecurity.

### How Data Analytics is integratabtle

Data Management: Data Analytics is integrable in Data management through SQL and schema design by ensuring efficient data handling.

Software Systems: Analytics helps models and can be embedded into applications for real-time insights in software systems.

Networking & Cybersecurity: Data Analytics and Data mining helps identify patterns of malicious behavior in the Cybersecurity and Networking.

### How Data Analytics is integratabtle with your prior work

My Previous work in CIDM 6350 and 6355 involved building relational databases and mining insights from structured data. These experiences help me directly to design secure, scalable, and intelligent systems.

## Conclusion

Finally Data Analytics is not just a standalone skill, it's a connective element that binds the other areas together. My journey through CIDM 5350 and 6355 has equipped me with the right and proper tools to analyze, interpret, and act on data. Hence as I prepare my Capstone portfolio, I will use these skills acquired to build a prototype that reflects integration across all areas, demonstrating my readiness to tackle issues and challenges.
