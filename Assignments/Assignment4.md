#  Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This repository showcases my academic and technical journey through the CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341 courses, highlighting my skills, projects, and preparedness for the Capstone project. 

##  What I Know

CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341 have expanded my understanding of how Data Analytics supports and enhances cybersecurity operations. I’ve developed strong competencies in using analytical tools and techniques to assess vulnerabilities, monitor network activity, and support strategic decision-making.

###  Key Competencies

- **Security Auditing and Vulnerability Assessment**  
  Proficient in using tools like Nessus, Shields Up, and NMAP to scan systems for vulnerabilities and generate actionable reports. Learned to interpret and visualize large volumes of scan data using Tableau.
- **Tableau for Cybersecurity Analytics**  
  Tableau has been instrumental in transforming raw scan data into visual dashboards that highlight risk levels, attack surfaces, and remediation priorities. This bridges the gap between technical findings and strategic insights.
- **Risk Management and Governance**  
  Applied analytical frameworks to assess cybersecurity risks, prioritize threats, and align security strategies with business objectives. Includes threat modeling and risk matrices to quantify exposure.
- **Strategic Business Analysis**  
  Strengthened ability to transform technical data into business-relevant insights through course exercises. Learned to evaluate how security decisions impact operations and compliance.

###  GitHub Evidence
- **CIDM 6340 Project Repository** https://github.com/BolajiCIDM6310/CIDM-6340.git  
  Demonstrates work in attack surface analysis and network intrusion detection.
- **CIDM 6341 Project Repository** https://github.com/BolajiCIDM6310/CIDM-6341.git  
  Includes vulnerability assessments and Tableau dashboards for security auditing.

##  Where I Am Weak
While I’ve gained valuable experience in applying analytics to cybersecurity, there are areas where I need further development:
- **Wireshark and Network Tracing**  
  Limited exposure to packet-level analysis using Wireshark. Less confident in interpreting network traces and identifying anomalies in real-time traffic.
- **Predictive Analytics for Threat Detection**  
  Have not yet implemented machine learning models to predict threats, limiting proactive security analytics capabilities.
- **Integration with SIEM Platforms**  
  Lack hands-on experience with SIEM tools like Splunk, which are essential for enterprise-level threat monitoring.
- **Ethical Reasoning in Data Use**  
  Need deeper understanding of ethical data handling, especially in cross-border and privacy-sensitive contexts.

##  What I Wish I Knew
To become a more effective cybersecurity analyst, I recognize the need to expand my knowledge in the following areas:
- **Real-Time Analytics and Automation**  
  Learn to build automated alert systems using Python and integrate them with network monitoring tools.
- **Advanced Statistical Techniques**  
  Understand how to apply regression, clustering, and anomaly detection to cybersecurity datasets.
- **Cloud Security Analytics**  
  Gain experience with cloud-native tools like Azure Sentinel for security analytics.

##  Supporting Evidence & Learning Sources
To build proficiency, I consulted various resources:
- **Course Materials**  
  CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341 provided structured learning in vulnerability assessment, risk modeling, and network security.
- **GitHub Projects**  
  Repositories showcase practical applications of data analytics in cybersecurity contexts.
- **Online Platforms**  
  Used Cybrary and Tableau Public to reinforce concepts in threat visualization and risk reporting.
- **Documentation and Forums**  
  Nessus and NMAP documentation, along with cybersecurity communities on Reddit and Stack Overflow, helped troubleshoot and refine techniques.

##  Summary Statement of Capabilities
I am confident in my ability to:
- Interpret vulnerability scan results and translate them into strategic actions.
- Apply systems thinking to align security decisions with business goals.
- Use data analytics tools to assess and visualize cybersecurity risks.
- Collaborate across technical and non-technical teams to communicate data-driven insights.

These competencies enable me to contribute meaningfully to cybersecurity analytics projects and evolve into a security-focused data analyst.

##  Capstone Integration

### Why Data Analytics is Integratable
- **Data Management**  
  Experience with vulnerability databases and risk registries supports structured data handling and compliance tracking.
- **Software Systems**  
  Used Python and Tableau to build analytical dashboards that integrate with security tools.
- **Networking and Cybersecurity**  
  Data Analytics enhances threat detection, incident response, and strategic planning.

### How Data Analytics Is Integratable
It connects with:
- **Data Management** through structured logging  
- **Software Systems** through analytical interfaces  
- **Networking** through traffic monitoring and anomaly detection.

### How Data Analytics Integrates with Prior Work
- **CIDM 6341 Tableau Dashboards**  
- **CIDM 6340 Threat Modeling Exercises**  
  These demonstrate how analytics supports cybersecurity decision-making.
