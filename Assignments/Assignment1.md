# What I Know and Core Competencies

**Visual Perception & Cognition:** I do have a good understanding of how users interpret visual data, enabling ethical and audience-aware storytelling.  
**Information Visualization Theory:** During this course, i become proficient in applying principles of clarity, color, and hierarchy to dashboard and report design.

## Tools & Techniques

- Tableau: Extensively used Tableau to develop interactive dashboards and time-series visualizations in CIDM 6312 and CIDM 6308.
- Python & R: Used Python and R for visualizing time-series data, exploratory analysis, and building time-series models.
- SQL:Extensively used SQL for data preparation and querying structured datasets, including joins and subqueries.
- RapidMiner: Enjoyed and use RM for Applied supervised and unsupervised clustering techniques; built predictive models using decision trees and logistic regression.
- Critical Reasoning with Data: Strong analytical thinking applied to clustering, dashboard design, and ethical visualization.

## Artifacts

- [CIDM-6308 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BolajiCIDM6310/CIDM-6308.git) – Clustering, Tableau dashboards, SQL queries.
- [CIDM-6312 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BolajiCIDM6310/CIDM-6312.git) – Narrative visualization, time-series analysis, ethical design.

## Where I’m Weak

- Limited proficiency in using Python and R for visualizing time-series and unsupervised clustering techniques.
- Minimal exposure to deploying analytics in full-stack environments or connecting dashboards to live databases.
- Basic proficiency in Excel; less confident with dynamic dashboards and complex modeling.
- Limited experience with real-time analytics.
- Need deeper understanding of unstructured data.

## What I Wish I Knew

- Real-Time Data Integration with skills in streaming data or connecting Tableau to live APIs.
- Data Governance & Cybersecurity with thorough knowledge of secure data handling and ethical compliance.
- Deployment Pipelines with experience in containerizing analytics workflows (e.g., Docker + Tableau Server) for enterprise use.

## Summary Statement of Capabilities

I’ve developed a strong foundation in data analytics, particularly in visual storytelling, dashboard design, and clustering analysis. I’m confident in designing and executing workflows using RapidMiner, R, Tableau, and SQL. My strength lies in structured analysis, visualization, and model interpretation.  
My ability to synthesize insights across tools positions me to deliver stakeholder-ready visualizations and data narratives. I’m prepared to apply these skills to real-world business problems, my Capstone portfolio, and prototype project—with a focus on ethical, audience-aware communication and integration with broader systems.

## Contribution Toward Capstone Integration

### Why Data Analytics Is Integratable

Data Analytics serves as the decision-making engine across systems, management, and security—translating raw data from software systems, databases, and networks into actionable insights.

### How Data Analytics Integrates with Other Areas

**Data Management:**Ensures clean, structured data for analysis via SQL, data prep, and clustering.  
**Software Systems:**Embeds dashboards and models into applications for intelligent automation.  
**Networking & Cybersecurity:**Detects anomalies and threats through pattern recognition and traffic monitoring.

### How It Integrates with Prior Work

- Tableau and Python used to visualize time-series data and clustering results—extendable to monitoring system performance, user behavior, and financial trends.
- SQL and Tableau connected analytics with data warehousing and reporting.
- RapidMiner workflows simulated real-world business scenarios.

### New Integrative Statement

Data Analytics is not just a standalone skill—it is the **powerhouse** through which all other technical areas become intelligible and actionable. By integrating analytics with data management, software systems, and cybersecurity, I can build intelligent, resilient solutions.

## Conclusion

This assessment reflects my journey through the Data Analytics curriculum. I’ve built a strong foundation in tools and techniques, identified growth areas, and developed a clear vision for integration. I’m excited to translate this into a compelling Capstone project.
