## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This repository showcases my academic and technical journey through the CIDM 6303 and CIDM 6325 courses, highlighting my skills, projects, and preparedness for the Capstone project. It also reflects my growth in Python programming, SQL, web development, and analytical thinking.

## What I Know

CIDM 6303 and CIDM 6325 has equipped me with a good foundational knowledge in Data Analytics, particularly in the area of Python programming, SQL querying, and data-driven web development. These skills have enabled me to analyze and present data in meaningful ways.

## Technical Skills

- Python for Data Analysis  
  Proficient in data manipulation using lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions.

## Where I'm Still Growing

While I have had some difficult time while trying to build a good foundation, I recognize several areas where my Data Analytics skills need further development, I’m actively working to improve in:

- Advanced statistical modeling (e.g., regression, clustering)
- Visualization tools beyond Python (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)
- Big data platforms (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Azure)
- Machine learning integration and deployment
- DevOps and Docker-based deployment workflows

## What I Wish I Knew

Indeed, to become a proficient Data Analytics professional, I do recognize the need to go beyond to have a deeper understanding in the following areas:

- Data governance and ethics (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Time series analysis for forecasting
- Real-time analytics (Apache Kafka, Flink)
- Cybersecurity integration for anomaly detection
- Software architecture for scalable systems

## Capstone Integration

### Why Data Analytics Is Integratable

- **Data Management**: SQL and PostgreSQL support structured storage and retrieval  
- **Software Systems**: Python and web development enable analytical applications  
- **Cybersecurity**: Analytics supports anomaly detection and SIEM systems

### How Data Analytics Is Integratable

Data Analytics drives decision-making across all domains. It connects with:  
- Data Management via databases  
- Software Systems via applications  
- Cybersecurity via threat monitoring

### How Data Analytics Is Integratable With your Prior work

My [CIDM 6325 Final Project](https://github.com/BolajiCIDM6310/CIDM6325-FinalProject.git) integrated database engineering, web development, and analytics—demonstrating cross-area collaboration.

## Final Statement

Data Analytics acts as the engine that powers intelligent decision-making across software systems, secure networks, and structured data environments. It transforms raw data into actionable intelligence, enabling seamless integration across the Capstone’s core areas. I can join these areas into a prototype project that reflects the full experience of my academic and technical growth.
