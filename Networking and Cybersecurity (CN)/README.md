# Networking and Cyber Security

When I began my graduate studies, I thought I had a better knowledge of networking and security concepts. CIDM‑6340 quickly showed me how much deeper the field really is. This course really sharpened my ability to approach cybersecurity with discipline and precision, and it gave me practical skills that I now apply both academically and professionally.

In CIDM‑6340, I worked extensively with tools such as Wireshark, NMAP, and Nessus. These applications allowed me to scan systems for vulnerabilities, analyze traffic patterns, and generate reports that highlighted risks and exposures. Using these tools built my confidence in identifying and responding to threats, though I faced challenges along the way. For example, interpreting packet and differentiating abnormal traffic from normal traffic was initially difficult. Over time, I became more comfortable creating filters, analyzing results, and understanding how firewalls and system configurations affect scans.

The most impactful part of CIDM‑6340 was learning how to design and implement incident response and recovery strategies. We studied the full cycle of responding to cyberattacks: detection, containment, communication, evidence preservation, redundancy, recovery, training, penetration testing, and continuous improvement. One of the project required me to create a ransomware recovery plan for an organization. This exercise emphasized that preparation is as important as response. Building a plan meant not only technical defenses but also employee awareness, organizational training, and strategies to protect data and reputation.

Following CIDM‑6340, I enrolled in CIDM‑6341 Current Issues in Cybersecurity. This course broadened my perspective by focusing on emerging threats, governance, and the business implications of security decisions. I learned how to evaluate vulnerabilities in the context of organizational risk, and how to communicate technical findings in ways that resonate with leadership. Tableau was a key tool in this course, helping me transform raw vulnerability data into dashboards that highlighted risk levels, attack surfaces, and remediation priorities. These visualizations bridged the gap between technical analysis and strategic decision‑making.

CIDM‑6341 also emphasized risk management frameworks and governance models. I practiced building risk matrices, prioritizing threats, and aligning security strategies with business objectives. This course reinforced the idea that cybersecurity is not just a technical issue but an organizational responsibility. Decisions about security affect compliance, operations, and reputation, and analytics plays a central role in guiding those decisions.

## Reflections
Through CIDM‑6340 and CIDM‑6341, I developed strong skills in:  
• Vulnerability assessment and security auditing  
• Packet analysis and network monitoring  
• Incident response and recovery planning  
• Risk management and governance frameworks  
• Tableau dashboards for cybersecurity analytics  

At the same time, I recognize areas where I need growth:  
• Advanced packet‑level analysis and anomaly detection  
• Predictive analytics and machine learning for proactive threat detection  
• Integration with SIEM platforms such as Splunk  
• Deeper knowledge of ethical reasoning in data use and privacy contexts  

## Future Considerations
Looking ahead, I plan to strengthen my technical foundation in several areas:  
• Cloud Security: Gain hands‑on experience with cloud‑native security tools such as Azure Sentinel and AWS GuardDuty.  
• Automation and Real‑Time Analytics: Build Python‑based scripts to automate monitoring and integrate with enterprise systems for faster detection.  
• Machine Learning for Threat Prediction: Explore clustering and anomaly detection models to proactively identify risks before they escalate.  
• Advanced Governance and Compliance: Deepen my understanding of frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST to ensure ethical and compliant data handling.  
• Professional Certifications: Pursue industry credentials such as CISSP, CEH, or AWS Security Specialty to validate and expand my expertise.  

These future goals will allow me to evolve from a reactive analyst into a proactive cybersecurity professional, capable of designing resilient systems and guiding organizations through the complex landscape of modern threats.
